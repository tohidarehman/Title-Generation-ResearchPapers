This study aims to distinguish pseudo progression from true progression. Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2012, a total of 161 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) were treated with chemoradiotherapy at our hospital. Among the patients, 79 had their diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data acquired at the earliest diagnosed date of pseudo progression or true progression, and 23 had both DTI data and genomic data. Clinical records of all patients were kept in good condition. Volumetric fractional anisotropy (FA) images obtained from the DTI data were decomposed into a sequence of sparse representations. Then, a feature selection algorithm was applied to extract the critical features from the feature matrix to reduce the size of the feature matrix and to improve the classification accuracy. Results: The proposed approach was validated using the 79 samples with clinical DTI data. Satisfactory results were obtained under different experimental conditions. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) was 0.87 for a given dictionary with 1024 atoms. For the subgroup of 23 samples, genomics data analysis was also performed. Results implied further perspective on pseudo progression classification. Conclusions: The proposed method can determine pseudo progression and true progression with improved accuracy. Laboring segmentation is no longer necessary because this skillfully designed method is not sensitive to tumor location.\",\n          \"Recently, several research efforts based on social network analysis and methods have been made for medical care information. One of these efforts is to extract the relationships between diseases by using social network modeling. However, all of previous works used the relationships in a simple way in a network consisting of diseases regardless of time or age factors. In this paper, we predict the onset of future diseases on the basis of the current health status of patients by considering age factor. The problem of predicting the relations between diseases is a really difficult and, at the same time, an important task. For this purpose, this paper first constructs a weighted disease network and then, it proposes a novel link prediction method, to identify the connections between diseases, building the evolving structure of the disease network with respect to patients\\u2019 ages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt in predicting the connections between diseases according to patients\\u2019 ages. Experiments on a real network demonstrate that the proposed approach can reveal disease correlations accurately and perform well at capturing future disease risks.\",\n          \"In this paper we study a classical parallel machine scheduling model with m machines and n jobs, where each job is either accepted and then processed by one of the machines, or rejected and then a rejection penalty is paid. The objective is to minimize the completion time of the last accepted job plus the total penalty of all rejected jobs. The scheduling problem is known to be NP-hard in the strong sense. We find some new optimal properties and develop an O(nlog n + n/\\u03b5) heuristic to solve the problem with a worst-case bound of 1.5 + \\u03b5, where \\u03b5 > 0 can be any small given constant. This improves upon the worst-case bound 2 \\u2212 1 m of the heuristic presented by Bartal et al. (Bartal, Y., Leonardi, S., Marchetti-Spaccamela, A., Sgall, J., & Stougie, L. (2000).
